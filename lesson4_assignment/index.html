        <h1> The Future of the Internet </h1>
        
        <h2><em> Overview </em></h2>
        
        <p> The internet has been around over for a few decades now and has completely changed the world with its functionality. It is made possible through the use of information technologies which are basically technologies that are constantly communicating important information to one another, thus allowing the internet to function. The internet alone has been a major catalyst for business innovation and business models have had to change because of it. The internet has also revolutionized the way the world communicates and has made it possible for almost everyone to be "connected". Although in its short life we have seen it change so many things, the internet itself and its potential has only just begun.  </p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h2><em> Internet of Things</em></h2>
        
        <p> The Internet of things (IoT) is a term that describes the ability of all devices being connected to the internet and to each-other seamlessly. These connections will enable devices to communicate more efficiently and "smarter" thus increasing their capabilities and functionality. This concept is made possible through the implementation of technology into devices that are traditionally not connected to the internet or a network. Examples of this can be anything from vehicles and watches to home appliances like a refrigerator or dishwasher. Including electronics, connectivity, and softwares into these devices allows them to connect and interact with other devices creating a digital ecosystem. </p>
        
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h2><em> 5G Networks </em></h2>
        
        <p> Another improvement that the internet will be seeing shortly is an upgrade in wireless network capabilities through 5G networks. This next generation of wireless communication technologies will allow for increased capacity, lower latency, and faster speeds. This improvement to the network will also allow innovation to take place and create new ways for people to communicate through the internet. </p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;</p>
        
        <h2><em> E-commerce </em></h2>
        
        <p> E-commerce refers to the act of selling or purchasing products and services over the internet.These exchanges between individuals online vary depending on who is involved and how they are facilitated. The more traditional models of e-commerce include business-to-consumer, businesss-to-business, consumer-to-consumer, and consumer-to-business. All of these models are used in the rapidly growing and vast e-commerce ecosystem. </P>
